This branch will contain all the current symbols distributed with KiCad, but categorized by the manufacturer name and a functional groups/features.

All the symbols will be redrawn using my own drawing policy. So, symbols in these libraries might not (In most cases: they won't) be exchangeable with or suitable to the existing schematics on the basis of these same components.

Please be patient, because this branch is currently under development. Also please *do not* merge this branch into other branches until it will be fully finished. The completion date is not specified.
